//what is data structure ?
//data structure is way of organizing and storing data.

DATA STRUCTURE TYPES-1)primitive-all data types(int,float,char,bool,string)
               2)non-primitive-(i)linear-(a)static-array
                                         (b)dynamic-vector,linked list,stack,queue.
                                (ii)non-linear-tree,graph

//c++ devloped by 1979 by Bjarne Strostrup at bell laboratories AT&T(American Telephone & Telegraph)in U.S.A.

//c++ founder Bjarne Strostrup.

//oop stand for object oriented programming.

// OOP is a programming paradigm that structures software around objects, which are instances of classes. 

//c++ superset of c.

//c subset of c++.

//C++ is powerful & versatile language.

//TRANSLATOR types:a)compiler
                   b)interpreter

//COMPILER converts program into binary.
//compiler faster than interpreter.
//compiler ex::c,c++.

//INTERPRETER converts line by line binary.
//interpreter slower than compiler.
//interpreter ex.::ruby,python.

->.c++ program basic structure:

//#=pre-processor.
//iostream-header/library file.
//namepace contains built-in classes & declared functions.

//variable-container which stores some data.
//DATA TYPES type of data stored.
//DATA TYPES used to defining a variable or functions.
//DATA TYPES EX.::char,int,float,string,bool.

//KEY WORDS::a reserved word  specific meaning.
//64 keywords in c++.

//CONST is keyword.
//CONST value fixed.
//CONST value can't be update/changed.

//OBJECT-object is specific instance of class.
//ex.::cin,cout,endl.

//cout-display the output to the console.
//cout using insertion operator.(<<)

//cin used to accept the input.
//cin using extraction operator.(>>)
//cin is reading input.

//endl:end of line.
//endl manipulator move the cursor to the beginning of the next line.

//OPRERATOR
//OPRERATOR is symbol of that represent a specific operation.
//TYPES OF OPRERATOR:(1)Arithmetic::+,-,*,/,%.
//                   (2)Relational::<,<=,==,>,>=,!=.
//                   (3)Logical::&&,||,!
//                   (4)Assignment::=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=.
//                   (5)Miscellaneous::sizeoof,?:,*,&,
//                   (6)Unary::++,--.

//TYPE CONVERSION::also konwn as TYPE CASTING.
//TYPE CASTING::The process of converting value from one data type to another.
//2 TYPES:(1)IMPLICIT::>perform by COMPILER.
          (2)EXPLICIT::>perform by casting operator type.
